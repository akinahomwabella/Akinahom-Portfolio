                        <p>
                            Hello üëãüèº! My name is Akinahom Wabella, a Computer Science and Statistics student at Minnesota State University, Mankato, with a minor in Math. My academic journey began with a love for mathematics, which naturally led me into computer science. Through some research and self-exploration, I discovered my passion for data science and machine learning‚Äîfields that perfectly blend my analytical mindset with impactful problem-solving.
                            <br><br>
                            My experiences range from teaching CS courses to conducting significant research on machine learning. I've successfully implemented machine learning projects during the first two years of my college career, and I would love to integrate that sector with web development for future projects. My projects have given me the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies, including an AI-driven adaptive learning platform and sentiment analysis tools, which I am designing to enhance user engagement and simplify complex concepts.
                            <br><br>
                            My passion for data science led me to be selected as one of 20 women across the US to receive a scholarship to attend the Academic Data Science Alliance conference. Beyond academics, I take great pride in my role as a leader and mentor in my college activities. I co-founded and serve as Vice President of the Leetcode Club at my college, helping others excel in coding challenges and career preparation. I also actively contribute to the NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers), where I‚Äôve developed communication plans and spearheaded outreach programs.
                            <br><br>
                            Aside from my tech experience, I love spending time reading classic literature, visiting jazz concerts, and going on hikes. My dedication to trying new things and learning new hobbies has earned me the title of "Jack of all trades." In the next couple of years, I hope to grow and learn from different communities, continuing to integrate various passions into my life in a way that makes a meaningful difference‚Äîfrom science and technology to the arts.
